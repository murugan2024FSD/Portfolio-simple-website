# Portfolio-simple-website
Welcome to my portfolio website! This site is designed to showcase my skills and projects as a web developer. It includes two main pages: Home and Contact, built using HTML and CSS.

Features:
Home Page: A landing page that introduces who I am, what I do, and highlights my work.
Contact Page: A page where visitors can find my contact information or send messages directly via a simple contact form.
Technologies Used:
HTML5 for structuring the content
CSS3 for styling and layout design
Getting Started:
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/portfolio-website.git
Open index.html (Home page) or contact.html (Contact page) in your browser to view the website.

This description now accurately reflects the two pages in your portfolio and provides clear instructions for accessing them. You can adjust the details as needed!
